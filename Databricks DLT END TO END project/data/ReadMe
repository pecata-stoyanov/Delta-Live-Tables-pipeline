Data Folder Overview

This folder contains the datasets used throughout the Delta Live Tables (DLT) pipeline.

Initial input data — raw CSV files representing Customers, Products, Stores, and Sales used for Bronze layer ingestion.

Update datasets — additional CSV files designed to simulate real-world changes in source systems. These are used to demonstrate:

SCD Type 2 dimensional tracking in Gold layer tables

Upserts (Merge/CDC) into Silver streaming tables

All files are used to validate ingestion, transformation logic, incremental processing, and automated Change Data Capture within the pipeline.
